# VeggieChoice

## Project Scope:
VeggieChoice provides the users with necessary information of vegetarian food stalls reviewed by other users who have visited the store. 

## Project Motivation: 
1.	Discover that vegetarians had great difficulty in locating nearby vegetarian stores
2.	Figure out that there is insufficient information on the stores (address, price point, menu, opening hours and recommended dishes) 
3.	Intent to create a strong bonded vegetarian community where users will have free access to all information and the ability to provide content (e.g. recommendations, feedback on the ambience) 

## Project Aim:
  We hope to provide users with special dietary requirements (e.g. vegetarians) a wider selection of food choices by providing them with directions to the nearby vegetarian stores. Furthermore, the application will also serve as a platform where foodies can share photos of the dishes they tried with other users in the application.
